                "Online evaluation continuously monitors deployed agents in production, unlike on-demand evaluation which analyzes specific selected interactions. It consists of three components: session sampling with configurable rules, multiple evaluation methods (built-in or custom evaluators), and monitoring through dashboards with quality trends and low-scoring session investigation.\n",
                "\n",
                "Since your agent runs on AgentCore Runtime, AgentCore Observability automatically instruments the code and provides comprehensive logs and traces using [OTEL](https://opentelemetry.io/) instrumentation.\n",
