    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 1, you built a Customer Support Agent that worked well for a single user in a local session. However, real-world customer support needs to scale beyond a single user running in a local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run an **Agent in Production**, we'll need:\n",
    "- **Multi-User Support**: Handle thousands of customers simultaneously\n",
    "- **Persistent Storage**: Save conversations beyond session lifecycle\n",
    "- **Long-Term Learning**: Extract customer preferences and behavioral patterns\n",
    "- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Remember customers across different interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Progress:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done)**: Create Agent Prototype - Build a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Current)**: Enhance with Memory - Add conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Scale with Gateway & Identity - Share tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Evaluate Agent Performance - Monitor quality with online evaluations\n",
    "- **Lab 6**: Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll add the missing persistence and learning layer that transforms your Goldfish-Agent (forgets the conversation in seconds) into an smart personalized Assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is a critical component of intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities, they lack persistent memory across conversations. [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/memory-getting-started.html) addresses this limitation by providing a managed service that enables AI agents to maintain context over time, remember important facts, and deliver consistent, personalized experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Memory operates on two levels:\n",
    "- **Short-Term Memory**: Immediate conversation context and session-based information that provides continuity within a single interaction or closely related sessions.\n",
    "- **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent information extracted and stored across multiple conversations, including facts, preferences, and summaries that enable personalized experiences over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory is a fully managed service that provides persistent memory capabilities for AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AgentCore Memory Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Immediately stores conversation context within the session\n",
    "2. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Asynchronously processes STM to extract meaningful patterns, preferences and facts\n",
    "3. **Memory Strategies**: Different approaches for extracting and organizing information:\n",
    "   - **USER_PREFERENCE**: Learns customer preferences, behaviors, and patterns\n",
    "   - **SEMANTIC**: Stores factual information using vector embeddings for similarity search\n",
    "4. **Namespaces**: Logical grouping of memories by customer and context type. We'll create these two namespaces:\n",
    "- `support/customer/{actorId}/preferences`: Customer preferences and behavioral patterns\n",
    "- `support/customer/{actorId}/semantic`: Factual information and conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables multi-tenant memory where each customer's information is isolated and easily retrievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Creation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating memory resources involves provisioning the underlying infrastructure (vector databases, processing pipelines, etc.). This typically takes 2-3 minutes as AWS sets up the managed services behind the scenes."
